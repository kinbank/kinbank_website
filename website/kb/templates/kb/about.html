<div id="aboutText">
Kinbank is a database of kinship terminologies to be used for exploring cross-linguistic diversity in kinship organisation and how that relates to behaviour. The database includes {{ n_languages }} languages and a set of 100 core kin types between Grandparents and Grandchildren, and between Parent's siblings, and Parent's siblings’ children. A major advantage of Kinbank is the focused language family sampling and sampling based on occurrence in existing anthropological databases (e.g. <a href"www.dplace.org">d-place.org</a>, allowing us to test the relationship between languages and behaviour. This allows the use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the states of proto-kinship, account for common ancestry in models of kinship change, and test for correlated evolution between linguistic and behavioural patterns.

<p><b>Languages</b></p>
Kinbank holds 183,282 different data points across 1,154 languages, built from a colloborative project between the Australian National University, the University of Bristol, the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, and the University of Helsinki. The collaborative approach to this project has resulted in a database with a broad global sample, coupled with focused sampling from specific language families. The digitisation of existing databases, such as Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity (Morgan, 1871), alongside opportunistic sampling from ethnographic databases and native speakers provides a broad global coverage of kinship terminology from societies experiencing a range of ecological pressures and kinship structures. Focused sampling for languages attached to existing cultural and linguistic databases (e.g. D-PLACE Kirby et al., 2016) and to computational language phylogenies (e.g. Honkola et al., 2013), allowing evolutionary analytic approaches to this important cultural domain. Finally, dense regional sampling in Tupian, Carib, and Uralic language families provides the opportunity to explore granular variation in kinship terminology. The project is citable as a whole, and as each project's subsets. 

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
The primary search criteria for Kinbank were a core set of 115 kin types (88 genealogical kin and and 27 kin by marriage (affines)). The sampling grid is available within the data repository. Kinbank differentiates between kin types (a genealogical position in the etic grid) and kin terms (the word used to describe one or more genealogical positions). For example: kin types such as father's brother and mother's brother, are covered by a single kinterm uncle in English, but by two terms ah-ta' and lake'-she, in Uncpapa Dakota (USA). The core set of kin types encompass the ‘nuclear’ family, up to grandparents and down to grandchildren, and from parents to their siblings and parent's siblings' children. Many languages have separate terms depending on the gender of the speaker and we collected all where available. Affinal terms were collected for spouses, spouses of siblings, and terms for spouse's nuclear family. Within ego's generation and ego's parent's generation, kin types are also distinguished by relative age, and age of linking relative, where appropriate. This set is derived from a genealogical grid of relatives and aims to capture a globally recurrent set of cross-culturally valid kin-members.
