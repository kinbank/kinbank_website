8. all cousins/sibling systems with an age distinction based on the birth order of the parents are not displayed, e.g Buli where the term fano mMeBS does not show up in the diagram or actually does not really fit the diagram. For those systems the cousin/sibling diagram would have to include the birth order of the parents, or it would have to be indicated in a different way. 

11. Dealing with languages with non-English letters appear at the bottom

13. In some languages where the kin terms are long, they don’t fit properly to the kinship diagram when it looks like this (pic below). Is there a way to change it somehow?

18. Would it be possible to have somewhere the info that how many languages there are per language family and listing the included language families? Especially as the language family focused sampling is emphasised in the About page.
